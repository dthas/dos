WHAT IS DTHAS?

DTHAS , designed for the experiment of simulating an OS , is a Unix-like system. As is just for researching, it consists of 6 necessary modules, which are the kernel module, the input-output module, the memory management module, the file system module, the network module and the library module. So far, It can work in text-mode ,support some shell commands and conduct simple communication with other computers by TCP/IP connection.
